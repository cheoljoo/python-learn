## 1.2. PyPy: Faster Python With Minimal Effort
- https://realpython.com/pypy-faster-python/
- PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter that is a worthy alternative to CPython 2.7, 3.6, and soon 3.7.
- The Python language specification is used in a number of implementations such as CPython (written in C), Jython (written in Java), IronPython (written for .NET), and PyPy (written in Python). 
- [CPython](https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/)

- python is 40 times slower than pypy in case of below example

### 1.2.1. installation

## 1.3. Develop Data Visualization Interfaces in Python With Dash (later)
- https://realpython.com/python-dash/
- Dash is an open source framework for building data visualization interfaces. Released in 2017 as a Python library, it’s grown to include implementations for R and Julia. Dash helps data scientists build analytical web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge.
- Three technologies constitute the core of Dash: 
    1. Flask supplies the web server functionality.
    1. React.js renders the user interface of the web page.
    1. Plotly.js generates the charts used in your application.
- But you don’t have to worry about making all these technologies work together. Dash will do that for you. You just need to write Python, R, or Julia and sprinkle it with a bit of CSS.

## 1.4. C for Python Programmers (easy for us : useless)
- https://realpython.com/c-for-python-programmers/
- The purpose of this tutorial is to get an experienced Python programmer up to speed with the basics of the C language and how it’s used in the CPython source code. It assumes you already have an intermediate understanding of Python syntax.



## 1.5. Common Python Data Structures (Guide)
- https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/
- Dictionaries, Maps, and Hash Tables
    - collections.OrderedDict: Remember the Insertion Order of Keys
        - import collections
        - d = collections.OrderedDict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    - collections.defaultdict: Return Default Values for Missing Keys
        ```python
        from collections import defaultdict
        dd = defaultdict(list)
        >>> # Accessing a missing key creates it and
        >>> # initializes it using the default factory,
        >>> # i.e. list() in this example:
        ```
    - collections.ChainMap: Search Multiple Dictionaries as a Single Mapping (grouping in ppt)
        - The collections.ChainMap data structure groups multiple dictionaries into a single mapping.
    - types.MappingProxyType: A Wrapper for Making Read-Only Dictionaries
        - read_only = MappingProxyType(writable)
        - >>> read_only["one"] = 23    ->>  Traceback (most recent call last):
- Array Data Structures
    - list: Mutable Dynamic Arrays
    - tuple: Immutable Containers
    - array.array: Basic Typed Arrays
        - Python’s array module provides space-efficient storage of basic C-style data types like bytes, 32-bit integers, floating-point numbers, and so on.
    - str: Immutable Arrays of Unicode Characters
    - bytes: Immutable Arrays of Single Bytes
    - bytearray: Mutable Arrays of Single Bytes
- Records, Structs, and Data Transfer Objects
    - Compared to arrays, record data structures provide a fixed number of fields. Each field can have a name and may also have a different type.
    - dict: Simple Data Objects
        - Python dictionaries store an arbitrary number of objects, each identified by a unique key.
        ```python
        >>> car1 = {
        ...     "color": "red",
        ...     "mileage": 3812.4,
        ...     "automatic": True,
        ... }
        ```
    - tuple: Immutable Groups of Objects
    - Write a Custom Class: More Work, More Control
        - class : Fields stored on classes are mutable, and new fields can be added freely, which you may or may not like. It’s possible to provide more access control and to create read-only fields using the @property decorator, but once again, this requires writing more glue code.
            ```python
            >>> class Car:
            ...     def __init__(self, color, mileage, automatic):
            ...         self.color = color
            ...         self.mileage = mileage
            ...         self.automatic = automatic
            ```
        - __repr__ method : https://shoark7.github.io/programming/python/difference-between-__repr__-vs-__str__
            - change into human understandable repression
        - str is internal class.   ```help(str)```  vs __str__ is method (function).
            - >>> 3 + 5  # 내부적으로 밑 문장을 실행!
            - >>> (3).__add__(5)  # '(3)'처럼 ()로 감싸야 한다. 소수와 구별해야 하기 때문이다.
    - dataclasses.dataclass: Python 3.7+ Data Classes
        - They provide an excellent alternative to defining your own data storage classes from scratch.
        
            ```python
            >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
            >>> @dataclass
            ... class Car:
            ...     color: str
            ...     mileage: float
            ...     automatic: bool
            ```
    - collections.namedtuple: Convenient Data Objects. (Python 2.6+)
        - dictionary is better. (charles)
    - typing.NamedTuple: Improved Namedtuples
    - struct.Struct: Serialized C Structs
        - The struct.Struct class converts between Python values and C structs serialized into Python bytes objects. For example, it can be used to handle binary data stored in files or coming in from network connections.
- Sets and Multisets
    - frozenset: Immutable Sets
    - collections.Counter: Multisets
- Stacks (LIFOs)
    - push / pop
    - DFS
    - list: Simple, Built-In Stacks
    - collections.deque: Fast and Robust Stacks (doubly linked list)
    - queue.LifoQueue: Locking Semantics for Parallel Computing
        - The LifoQueue stack implementation in the Python standard library is synchronized and provides locking semantics to support multiple concurrent producers and consumers.
- Queues (FIFOs)
    - BFS
    - Scheduling algorithms often use priority queues internally. These are specialized queues. Instead of retrieving the next element by insertion time, a priority queue retrieves the highest-priority element. The priority of individual elements is decided by the queue based on the ordering applied to their keys.
    - list: Terribly Sloooow Queues
    - collections.deque: Fast and Robust Queues
    - queue.Queue: Locking Semantics for Parallel Computing
    - multiprocessing.Queue: Shared Job Queues
        - multiprocessing.Queue is a shared job queue implementation that allows queued items to be processed in parallel by multiple concurrent workers. Process-based parallelization is popular in CPython due to the global interpreter lock (GIL) that prevents some forms of parallel execution on a single interpreter process.
- Priority Queues
    - A priority queue is a container data structure that manages a set of records with totally-ordered keys to provide quick access to the record with the smallest or largest key in the set.
    - Priority queues are commonly used for dealing with scheduling problems. For example, you might use them to give precedence to tasks with higher urgency.
    - **queue.PriorityQueue stands out from the pack with a nice object-oriented interface and a name that clearly states its intent. It should be your preferred choice.**
    - **If you’d like to avoid the locking overhead of queue.PriorityQueue, then using the heapq module directly is also a good option.**

## 1.9. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3
- https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
- Class
    - Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.
```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Instance method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    # Another instance method
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} barks {sound}"

    # Replace .description() with __str__()
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"
```
    - an instance method’s first parameter is always self.
    - Methods like .__init__() and .__str__() are called dunder methods because they begin and end with double underscores.

- Inherit From Other Classes in Python
    - Child classes can override or extend the attributes and methods of parent classes. 
```python
class JackRussellTerrier(Dog):
    def speak(self, sound="Arf"):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"

class Dachshund(Dog):
    def speak(self, sound="Arf"):
        return super().speak(sound)


class Bulldog(Dog):
    pass
```
    - What if you want to determine if miles is also an instance of the Dog class? You can do this with the built-in isinstance().
    - You can access the parent class from inside a method of a child class by using super():


## 1.10. Python Bindings: Calling C or C++ From Python
- https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/
- Marshalling Data Types
    - marshalling : The process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission.
- Understanding Mutable and Immutable Values
- Managing Memory

- ctypes is  built into the standard library.
- [python and C binding example : from ctypes import cdll](https://hashcode.co.kr/questions/243/python%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-cc%EB%B6%80%EB%A5%B4%EA%B8%B0)
    - cd binding ; make      <- works well
    - You’ll start with ctypes, which is a tool in the standard library for creating Python bindings. It provides a low-level toolset for loading shared libraries and marshalling data between Python and C.
- materials : https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/python-bindings

## 1.11. Functional Programming in Python: When and How to Use It
- https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the primary method of computation is evaluation of functions. In this tutorial, you’ll explore functional programming in Python.
    - What the functional programming paradigm entails
    - hat it means to say that functions are first-class citizens in Python
    - How to define anonymous functions with the lambda keyword
    - How to implement functional code using map(), filter(), and reduce()

### 1.11.1. What Is Functional Programming?
- In functional programming, a program consists entirely of evaluation of pure functions. Computation proceeds by nested or composed function calls, without changes to state or mutable data.

### 1.11.2. How Well Does Python Support Functional Programming?
- two abilities:
  1. To take another function as an argument
  1. To return another function to its caller
- you can assign a function to a variable. You can then use that variable the same as you would use the function itself:
    ```python
    >>> def func():
    ...     print("I am function func()!")
    ...

    >>> func()
    I am function func()!

    >>> another_name = func
    >>> another_name()
    I am function func()!
    ```
- refer to https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/
- When you pass a function to another function, the passed-in function sometimes is referred to as a callback because a call back to the inner function can modify the outer function’s behavior.
    ```python
    >>> animals = ["ferret", "vole", "dog", "gecko"]
    >>> sorted(animals, key=len, reverse=True)
    ['ferret', 'gecko', 'vole', 'dog']

    >>> def reverse_len(s):
    ...     return -len(s)
    ...
    >>> sorted(animals, key=reverse_len)
    ['ferret', 'gecko', 'vole', 'dog']
    ```
    - You can check out [How to Use sorted() and sort() in Python](https://realpython.com/python-sort/) for more information on sorting data in Python.


### 1.11.3. Defining an Anonymous Function With lambda
- syntax --> lambda <parameter_list>: <expression>
    ```python
    >>> lambda s: s[::-1]
    <function <lambda> at 0x7fef8b452e18>

    >>> callable(lambda s: s[::-1])
    True

    >>> reverse = lambda s: s[::-1]
    >>> reverse("I am a string")
    'gnirts a ma I'

    >>> (lambda s: s[::-1])("I am a string")
    'gnirts a ma I'

    >>> (lambda x1, x2, x3: (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3)(9, 6, 6)
    7.0
    >>> (lambda x1, x2, x3: (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3)(1.4, 1.1, 0.5)
    1.0
    ```
- The return value from a lambda expression can only be one single expression. A lambda expression can’t contain statements like assignment or return, nor can it contain control structures such as for, while, if, else, or def.
- This implicit tuple packing doesn’t work with an anonymous lambda function
    ```python
    >>> (lambda x: x, x ** 2, x ** 3)(3)
    <stdin>:1: SyntaxWarning: 'tuple' object is not callable; perhaps you missed a comma?
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'x' is not defined

    >>> (lambda x: (x, x ** 2, x ** 3))(3)
    (3, 9, 27)
    >>> (lambda x: [x, x ** 2, x ** 3])(3)
    [3, 9, 27]
    >>> (lambda x: {1: x, 2: x ** 2, 3: x ** 3})(3)
    {1: 3, 2: 9, 3: 27}
    ```
- [How to Use Python Lambda Functions.](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)
- Python offers two built-in functions, map() and filter(), that fit the functional programming paradigm.

### 1.11.4. Applying a Function to an Iterable With map()
#### 1.11.4.1. Calling map() With a Single Iterable
- syntax --> map(<f>, <iterable>)
- remember, map() doesn’t return a list. It returns an iterator called a map object. To obtain the values from the iterator, you need to either iterate over it or use list():
    ```python
    >>> animals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog", "gecko"]
    >>> iterator = map(reverse, animals)
    >>> iterator
    <map object at 0x7fd3558cbef0>

    >>> iterator = map(reverse, animals)
    >>> for i in iterator:
    ...     print(i)
    ...
    tac
    god
    gohegdeh
    okceg

    >>> iterator = map(reverse, animals)
    >>> list(iterator)
    ['tac', 'god', 'gohegdeh', 'okceg']
    ```
- '1+2+3+4+5'
    ```python
    >>> "+".join([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found

    >>> strings = []
    >>> for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    ...     strings.append(str(i))
    ...
    >>> strings
    ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
    >>> "+".join(strings)
    '1+2+3+4+5'

    >>> "+".join(map(str, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    '1+2+3+4+5'
    ```
#### 1.11.4.2. Calling map() With Multiple Iterables
- syntax --> map(<f>, <iterable₁>, <iterable₂>, ..., <iterableₙ>)
    ```python
    >>> def f(a, b, c):
    ...     return a + b + c
    ...

    >>> list(map(f, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30], [100, 200, 300]))
    [111, 222, 333]
    ```
    - ![map with multiple iterables](https://files.realpython.com/media/t.130d7baf2cca.png)

### 1.11.5. Selecting Elements From an Iterable With filter()
- syntax --> filter(<f>, <iterable>)
  - filter(<f>, <iterable>) applies function <f> to each element of <iterable> and returns an iterator that yields all items for which <f> is truthy. Conversely, it filters out all items for which <f> is falsy.
```python
>>> def greater_than_100(x):
...     return x > 100
...

>>> list(filter(greater_than_100, [1, 111, 2, 222, 3, 333]))
[111, 222, 333]

>>> list(filter(lambda x: x > 100, [1, 111, 2, 222, 3, 333]))
[111, 222, 333]



>>> animals = ["cat", "Cat", "CAT", "dog", "Dog", "DOG", "emu", "Emu", "EMU"]

>>> def all_caps(s):
...     return s.isupper()
...
>>> list(filter(all_caps, animals))
['CAT', 'DOG', 'EMU']

>>> list(filter(lambda s: s.isupper(), animals))
['CAT', 'DOG', 'EMU']
```
### 1.11.6. reduce
- syntax --> reduce(<f>, <iterable>)
    ```python
    >>> def f(x, y):
    ...     return x + y
    ...

    >>> from functools import reduce
    >>> reduce(f, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    15
    ```
    - ![reduce progress](https://files.realpython.com/media/t.5446e98a36c1.png)
- implement filter() using reduce()
    ```python
    >>> numbers = list(range(10))
    >>> numbers
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    >>> def is_even(x):
    ...     return x % 2 == 0
    ...

    >>> list(filter(is_even, numbers))
    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

    >>> def custom_filter(function, iterable):
    ...     from functools import reduce
    ...
    ...     return reduce(
    ...         lambda items, value: items + [value] if function(value) else items,
    ...         iterable,
    ...         []
    ...     )
    ...
    >>> list(custom_filter(is_even, numbers))
    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```



## 1.12. Primer on Python Decorators
- https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/
- a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
    - takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters),
    - returns a function as its result.
- By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
- functions
  - generally functions are fist class objects.
  - inner function : function can have inner function to use it and return it.
  - return functions from functions
- simple decorators
    ```python
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            func()
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return wrapper

    def say_whee():
        print("Whee!")

    say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)
    ```
    - Syntactic Sugar!
        - First of all, you end up typing the name say_whee three times.
        ```python
        def my_decorator(func):
            def wrapper():
                print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
                func()
                print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
            return wrapper

        @my_decorator
        def say_whee():
            print("Whee!")
        ```
        - So, @my_decorator is just an easier way of saying say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee). It’s how you apply a decorator to a function.
    - Reusing Decorators
        - Recall that a decorator is just a regular Python function. All the usual tools for easy reusability are available

- 일반적인 시스템은 단일 애플리케이션으로 구동이 되지 않습니다. 여러 개의 애플리케이션이 서로 의존성 있게 구성되어 시스템이 이뤄져 있습니다. 그렇다면 흔히 하나의 컨테이너가 하나의 애플리케이션을 담당한다고 하면 여러 개의 컨테이너가 필요로 합니다. 이때 필요한 기술이 도커 컴포즈(Docker Compose)입니다. 도커 컴포즈는 yaml 포맷으로 작성되며 여러 개의 컨테이너의 실행을 한 번에 관리를 할 수 있게 해 줍니다.
